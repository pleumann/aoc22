# Advent of Code 2022
This repo contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://www.adventofcode.com)
in Java, all wrapped in a NetBeans project.

After building, the typical way to run a certain puzzle is (from the project directory):

```
java -cp dist/AdventOfCode22.jar day01.Puzzle src/day01/input.txt
```

Replace day (01-25) number as needed.

Some days may contain additional classes with optimized solutions or one or more
```example.txt``` files that could be fed into the main class as a replacement
for ```input.txt```.

Some days may contain ports of the solution to a different language or platform
(mostly Pascal and CP/M, as I'm working on a simple Pascal compiler for Z80).

See individual directories for details.

Note that ```input.txt``` contains the input data I received. Yours may (and
probably will) be different.
